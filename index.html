      <p>
        Coding is not just a hobby; it’s a valuable skill in today’s job market.
        Furthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected that by
        2029, demand for developers will grow by 22%. Learning to code can open
        doors to a wide range of career opportunities for children with ADHD,
        helping them build a brighter future.
      </p>

      <p>
        As children with ADHD and Autism develop coding skills, they may
        discover a passion for programming and pursue careers in software
        development, game design, data analysis, or other related fields.

      <h2>Impact!</h2>

      <img src="" />
      <h3>Enhancing Cognitive Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Children with ADHD often struggle with sustaining attention and focus.
        Coding requires systematic thinking, problem-solving, and attention to
        detail, which can help improve their ability to concentrate and stay
        engaged in tasks.
      </p>

      <img src="" />
      <h3>Developing Logical and Sequential Thinking</h3>
      <p>
        Coding involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable
        steps, promoting logical and sequential thinking. This structured
        approach can be particularly beneficial for children with Autism who may
        prefer routines and order.
      </p>

      <img src="" />
      <h3>Strengthening Memory and Processing Speed</h3>
      <p>
        Through coding, children must remember and execute various commands and
        algorithms. This process can enhance their working memory and processing
        speed, which are vital cognitive skills.
